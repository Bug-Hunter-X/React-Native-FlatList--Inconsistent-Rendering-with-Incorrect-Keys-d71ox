This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component: using an index as a key.  This often leads to incorrect rendering, especially when data is updated. The example shows how using index as a key causes issues, and the solution demonstrates the proper way to use unique keys to avoid these problems.  Ensure each item has a unique key for optimal FlatList performance and accurate rendering.
