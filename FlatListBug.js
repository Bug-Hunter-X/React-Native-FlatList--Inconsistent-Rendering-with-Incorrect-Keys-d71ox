This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid key prop to its items.  The key prop must be unique for each item within the FlatList. If you use an index as a key, this can lead to unpredictable behavior especially if you're updating data. For example if you remove an item in the middle of the array, the following items will not re-render correctly. This causes rendering issues, such as items not showing, incorrect display of items, or unexpected behavior when updating items in the list.
